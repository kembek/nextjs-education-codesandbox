# Parallel Routes

Parallel routes are an advanced routing mechanism that allows for the simultaneous rendering of multiple pages within the same layout.

## Prallel Routes contd.

Parallel routes in Next.js are defined using a feature known as slots.

Slots help structure our content in a modular fashion.

To define a slot, we use the '@folder' naming convention.

Each slot is then passed as a prop to its corresponding `layouts.tsx` file.

## Parallel Route Benefits

A clear benefit of parallel routes is their ability to split a single layout into various slots, making the code more manageable.

- Independent route handling.
- Sub-navigation.

## Independet Route Handling

Each slot of your layout, such as user analytics or revenue metrics, can have its own loading and error states.

This granular control is particulary benefical in scenarios where different actions of the page load at varying speeds or encounter unique errors.

## Sub-navigation in routes

Each slot of your dashboard can essentially function as a mini-application, complete with its own navigation and state management.

This is especially useful in a complex application such as our dashboard where different sections serve distinct purposes.
