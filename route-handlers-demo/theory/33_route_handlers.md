# Route Handlers

We can also create custom request handlers for our routes using a feature called route handlers. Unlike page routes, which respond with HTML content, route handlers allow you to create RESTful endpoints, giving you full control over the response. There is no overhead of having to create and configure a separate server. Route handlers are also great for making external API requests. Route handlers run server-side, ensuring that sensitive information like private keys remains secure and never gets shipped to the browser. Route Handlers are the equivalent of API routes in Page router.
