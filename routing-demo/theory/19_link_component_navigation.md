# Navigation

File based routing.

We manually entered the URLs in the browser's address bar to navigate to the different routes.

Users rely on UI elements like links to navigate:

- Clicking on them or
- Through programmatic navigation after completing an action

## Link Component Navigation

To enable client-side navigation Next.js provides us with the Link component.

The `<Link>` component is a React component that extends the HTML `<a>` element, and it's the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.

To use it, we need to import it from "next/link".
